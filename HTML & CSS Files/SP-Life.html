                As you can see, these are the types of classrooms present in SP! They very much differ from the single tables and chairs from secondary school, and was quite a nice change. Fitted with air-conditioning and charging ports, these classrooms are equipped for the use of our laptops. To be honest, almost every studying table present in SP has a charging port to allow its students to charge their electronic devices such as laptops and mobile phones.

                Ah yes, Hilltop. Being in Block T22, the closest 'library', as many would consider it, would be Hilltop Haven. Equipped with an in-house cafe and freezing air-conditioning temperatures, many students would consider the multi-storey building a haven to study in. See what I did there? My personal experience with Hilltop is rather positive, as my friends and I would head off to Hilltop after classes to finish our homework and collaborate on group projects.

            <h4>
                As we are currently in Home Based Learning at the time of the creation of this paragraph, I would love to head back to Hilltop to study with friends. Its alluring nature and rather chilly environment is one-of-a-kind, and keeps me going back for more study sessions. Until then, the bedroom study table and the sweltering Singapore weather will have to do.

                Foodcourts in SP have generally been quite crowded during meal times, with queues that can stretch on for 15-20 minutes. And even if one would be able to purchase a meal before their break ended, finding a seat would be a nightmare; there's always not enough seats! However, the low prices at foodcourts combined with the ability for cashless payment makes the foodcourts in SP a viable option for a filling and cheap meal
