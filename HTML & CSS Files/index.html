        About
        </h1>
        <p>
        Throughout my life, I have sought to better my skills and interpersonal relations with others as a driven, resilient and motivated individual. Having had a strong passion for algorithms and the usage of machine learning, I have been coding since 2013 and reading academic journals about data science since early 2018. These early hands-on experiences with coding have led me to desire to explore data using unsupervised machine learning to help solve a myriad of business problems as a data analyst or scientist. My strong leadership background and passion for helping others by volunteering lends itself well in my lifelong journey in becoming a well-rounded individual who can contribute to society.

        My Personality (INTJ & Enneagram Type 1)
        </h1>
       <p>
        INTJs are analytical problem-solvers, eager to improve systems and processes with their innovative ideas. I have a talent for seeing possibilities for improvement, whether at work, at home, or in myself.

Often intellectual, INTJs enjoy logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. I approach life by analyzing the theory behind what I see, and am typically focused inward, on my own thoughtful study of the world around me. INTJs are drawn to logical systems and are much less comfortable with the unpredictable nature of other people and their emotions. I am typically independent and selective about their relationships, preferring to associate with people who they I intellectually stimulating.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
           Type Ones have a “sense of mission” that leads them to want to improve the world in various ways, using whatever degree of influence they have. They strive to overcome adversity—particularly moral adversity—so that the human spirit can shine through and make a difference. They strive after “higher values,” even at the cost of great personal sacrifice.Ones are people of practical action—they wish to be useful in the best sense of the word. On some level of consciousness, they feel that they “have a mission” to fulfill in life, if only to try their best to reduce the disorder they see in their environment.

                    Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape.

                    Back in the Circuit Breaker, I picked up Online Chess and started to get better at it over a short period of time. After about 6 months, I can confidently say that I am much better at chess, so much so that I am now enrolled in SP MindSports CCA in the Chess division, albeit I'm still a beginner. However, with time, I am sure that in the future, I am able to grind up the ranks and finally attain the rank of Grand Master. In Chess, Grandmaster (GM) is a title awarded to chess players by the world chess organization FIDE. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain.

                    3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical coordinate-based representation of any surface of an object (inanimate or living) in three dimensions via specialized software.Three-dimensional (3D) models represent a physical body using a collection of points in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc. Being a collection of data (points and other information), 3D models can be created manually, algorithmically (procedural modeling), or by scanning. Their surfaces may be further defined with texture mapping.

                <h4 class="second-para">
                    Back in the 2017, when I first joined my Secondary School CCA Mechatronics, I was tasked with the job of picking up the skill of how to 3D Model. In a short time, I got rather competent at it, and I lead a team of juniors to the NYP Underwater Challenge 2019, where the premise of the competition was to build a boat that could carry the largest payload and travel the fastest. Suffice to say, I conquered all the other boats and became national champion, bringing home the trophy for my school. Ah, good memories.
