                A Machine Learning Engineer turns raw data into valuable insights that an organisation needs in order to grow and compete. They interpret and analyse data from multiple sources to come up with imaginative solutions to problems. Machine learning engineers develop self-running AI software to automate predictive models for recommended searches, virtual assistants, translation apps, chatbots, and driver-less cars. They design machine learning systems, apply algorithms to generate accurate predictions, and resolve data set problems. Their focus goes beyond specifically programming machines to perform specific tasks. They create programs that will enable machines to take actions without being specifically directed to perform those tasks

                A Data Analyst interprets data and turns it into information which can offer ways to improve a business, thus affecting business decisions. A Data Analyst gathers information from various sources and interpret patterns and trends – as such a Data Analyst job description should highlight the analytical nature of the role. Once data has been gathered and interpreted, the Data Analyst reports back what has been found in a comprehensive study to the wider business/relevant colleagues.

                Data architects are senior visionaries who translate business requirements into technology requirements and define data standards and principles. The data architect is responsible for visualizing and designing an organization's enterprise data management framework. This framework describes the processes used to plan, specify, enable, create, acquire, maintain, use, archive, retrieve, control, and purge data. The data architect also provides a standard common business vocabulary, expresses strategic requirements, outlines high-level integrated designs to meet those requirements, and aligns with enterprise strategy and related business architecture.

            <h4>
                 Typical data architect responsibilities include:
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Translating business requirements into technical specifications, including data streams, integrations, transformations, databases, and data warehouses</li>
                <li>Defining the data architecture framework, standards and principles, including modeling, metadata, security, reference data such as product codes and client categories, and master data such as clients, vendors, materials, and employees</li>
                <li>Defining reference architecture, which is a pattern that others can follow to create and improve data systems</li>
                <li>Defining data flows, i.e., which parts of the organization generate data, which require data to function, how data flows are managed, and how data changes in transition</li>
                <li>Collaborating and coordinating with multiple departments, stakeholders, partners, and external vendors</li>

                Data engineers are responsible for finding trends in data sets and developing algorithms to help make raw data more useful to the enterprise. This IT role requires a significant set of technical skills, including a deep knowledge of SQL database design and multiple programming languages. But data engineers also need communication skills to work across departments to understand what business leaders want to gain from the company’s large datasets.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Data engineers are often responsible for building algorithms to help give easier access to raw data, but to do this, they need to understand company’s or client’s objectives. It’s important to have business goals in line when working with data, especially for companies that handle large and complex datasets and databases.

                A data steward is an oversight or data governance role within an organization, and is responsible for ensuring the quality and fitness for purpose of the organization's data assets, including the metadata for those data assets. A data steward may share some responsibilities with a data custodian, such as the awareness, accessibility, release, appropriate use, security and management of data. A data steward would also participate in the development and implementation of data assets. A data steward may seek to improve the quality and fitness for purpose of other data assets their organization depends upon but is not responsible for.
